## About The Project

**What's This About:** Hi there! Welcome to the 'Yoga Style e-shop' project, a work-in-progress endeavor aimed at enhancing skills in frontend development. The project is a personal journey to deepen understanding and proficiency in React, TypeScript, and Jest while simultaneously exploring the intricacies of building an e-commerce platform.

**Why Am I Doing This:** The motivation behind starting this project is the desire to refine my abilities in website development. Specifically, I'm focused on mastering these foundational technologies essential for creating modern, efficient web applications.

**How It's Set Up:** The website part is hosted on Netlify, and I've got the backend stuff on my own server at Linode. Both parts work together to make the whole thing run.

The corresponding backend for this project is available in my repository, located at [Yoga-Style-eShop-backend repository:](https://github.com/RalitsaLefterova/Yoga-Style-eShop-backend).

**Always Learning:** This project is always changing as I learn new things. I'm open to feedback and ideas from others to make it even better!

**What's Next:** I'll keep improving the site, adding new features, and making it run faster. And I'll keep exploring new ways to make websites awesome!
